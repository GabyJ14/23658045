# Introduction \label{Introduction}
The upcoming Paris Olympics has many people excited for how their countries will perform. India in particular, is more than excited to see how their national team will perform on the global stage. India usually performs very well in field hockey and the same is expected for this year. In this summary I will answer the following questions: 



#Data

```{r}
#in this code chunk I will prepare the data and load necessary libraries

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

#loading the data
summer_data <- read_rds("C:/Users/gabyd/Desktop/DataScience/Exam/23658045/Question4/data/olympics/summer.rds")
winter_data <- read_rds("C:/Users/gabyd/Desktop/DataScience/Exam/23658045/Question4/data/olympics/winter.rds")
GDP_data <- read_rds("C:/Users/gabyd/Desktop/DataScience/Exam/23658045/Question4/data/olympics/GDP.rds")


#adjusting the data for team sports
summer_df <- adj_data_team(summer_data)
winter_df <- adj_data_team(winter_data)


```
How has India faired in past summer Olympics compared to similarly sized economies, to other emerging market economies and also select South American countries? 
To answer this question, I firstly add the medals for each country then divide the sum by the GDP per capita variable form the GDP.rds file.


```{r}

summer_medals_country_df <- medals_per_country(summer_df) #this is now a data frame with just the country and total medals per country
#merged dataset with medals and gdp
merged_medals_gdp_df <- merged_medals_gdp(summer_medals_country_df, GDP_data) 
colnames(merged_medals_gdp_df)[6] = "GDP_per_Capita"


merged_medals_gdp_df<- merged_medals_gdp_df %>% 
    mutate(medals_per_capita = team_medals/Population, medals_per_gdp = team_medals/ (GDP_per_Capita) * Population)
#emerging markets: brazil, south africa, china, mexico, indonesia
compare_countries <- c("BRA", "RSA", "CHN", "MEX", "INA", "IND", "ARG", "PER", "CHI")

g<- compare_plot(merged_medals_gdp_df, compare_countries)
g

```

The plots above show that India doesn't do well compared to other emerging economies and selected South American countries. China outperforms the other countries except when population is taken into account. This is not surprising. 
\newpage

The next question that I will be answering is: Which countries have been most dominant in both Winter and Summer Olympics over
time? Maybe show some time-series analyses of a few countries side-by-side.

```{r Figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}
#summarize medals by year and country
sum_medals_year_country_df <- medals_per_year_country(summer_df)
win_medals_year_country_df <- medals_per_year_country(winter_df)

#top countries: summer
sum_top_df <- sum_medals_year_country_df %>%  group_by(Year, Country) %>% 
    arrange(Year, desc(team_medals)) %>% 
    select(Year, Country, team_medals)
top_5_year_summer_df <- sum_top_df %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = team_medals, n = 5) %>%
  ungroup()


#top countries: winter
win_top_df <- win_medals_year_country_df %>%  group_by(Year, Country) %>% 
    arrange(Year, desc(team_medals)) %>% 
    select(Year, Country, team_medals)
top_5_year_winter_df <- win_top_df %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = team_medals, n = 5) %>%
  ungroup()

#plot time series for both summer and winter
g<- top_countries_plot(top_5_year_winter_df, Title = "Top 5 Countries in Winter Olympics Over Time")
g


```

```{r Figure3, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}
h <- top_countries_plot(top_5_year_summer_df, Title = "Top 5 Countries in Summer Olympics Over Time")
h
```
Figure 2 and 3 show the dominant countries over time. Explain more

\newpage
Question: Which countries best punch above their weight when it comes to winning medals (however
you define this)?
I interpreted this question as realistic as possible. I decided to look at which countries perform well in boxing. 



```{r}
#filter for boxing
boxing_df <- summer_data %>% 
    filter(Sport == "Boxing")

boxing <- medals_per_country(boxing_df) %>% 
    arrange(desc(team_medals)) %>% 
    head(20)

w <- plot_sport(boxing, "Total Medals for Boxing")
w

```

The Figure above shows that the USA has outperformed all other countries over the years. In second place, Cuba, also performed well. Especially since Cuba is a small country, Cuba is as big as the state of Tennessee in the USA. For that reason, I would say that Cuba definitely punches above their weight. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/gabyd/Desktop/DataScience/Exam/23658045/Question4/punch.jpg")
```

\newpage
Question: Which is your personal favourite event at the Olympics? Show some interesting analyses
on past winners / countries related to your chosen event.

My favourite is football. I have always enjoyed watching Brazil play football. Therefore for this question I will be looking at Brazil's performance in football over the years. 


```{r}
map_plot <- football_map_world(summer_df, "Countries That Have Won Medals for Football at the Summer Olympics")
map_plot

```

Figure 4 shows the countries that have won medals for football at the Summer Olympics. Interesting to note that not a lot of African countries have won medals at the Olympics. Unsurprisingly, many European countries, Brazil and Argentina have won medals. This is expected since these countries also perform well in the Fifa World Cup and other international tournaments. 

# Conclusion
In this summary, I answered the questions that were asked and used some creative plots to analyse the Olympics data.
