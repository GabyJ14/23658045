<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')

# Lets load in example data, and see how this can be stored and later called from your 'data' folder.

# Introduction \label{Introduction}
The upcoming Paris Olympics has many people excited for how their countries will perform. India in particular, is more than excited to see how their national team will perform on the global stage. India usually performs very well in field hockey and the same is expected for this year. In this summary I will answer the following questions: 



#Data

```{r}
#in this code chunk I will prepare the data and load necessary libraries

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

#loading the data
summer_data <- read_rds("C:/Users/gabyd/Desktop/DataScience/Exam/23658045/Question4/data/olympics/summer.rds")
winter_data <- read_rds("C:/Users/gabyd/Desktop/DataScience/Exam/23658045/Question4/data/olympics/winter.rds")
GDP_data <- read_rds("C:/Users/gabyd/Desktop/DataScience/Exam/23658045/Question4/data/olympics/GDP.rds")


#adjusting the data for team sports
summer_df <- adj_data_team(summer_data)
winter_df <- adj_data_team(winter_data)


```
How has India faired in past summer Olympics compared to similarly sized economies, to other emerging market economies and also select South American countries? 
To answer this question, I firstly add the medals for each country then divide the sum by the GDP per capita variable form the GDP.rds file.


```{r}
summer_medals_country_df <- medals_per_country(summer_df) #this is now a data frame with just the country and total medals per country
#merged dataset with medals and gdp
merged_medals_gdp_df <- merged_medals_gdp(summer_medals_country_df, GDP_data) 
colnames(merged_medals_gdp_df)[6] = "GDP_per_Capita"


merged_medals_gdp_df<- merged_medals_gdp_df %>% 
    mutate(medals_per_capita = team_medals/Population, medals_per_gdp = team_medals/ (GDP_per_Capita) * Population)




#emerging markets: brazil, south africa, china, mexico, indonesia
compare_countries <- c("BRA", "RSA", "CHN", "MEX", "INA", "IND", "ARG", "PER", "CHI")

g<- compare_plot(merged_medals_gdp_df, compare_countries)
g

```

\newpage

The next question that I will be answering is: Which countries have been most dominant in both Winter and Summer Olympics over
time? Maybe show some time-series analyses of a few countries side-by-side.

```{r Figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}
#summarize medals by year and country
sum_medals_year_country_df <- medals_per_year_country(summer_df)
win_medals_year_country_df <- medals_per_year_country(winter_df)

#top countries: summer
sum_top_df <- sum_medals_year_country_df %>%  group_by(Year, Country) %>% 
    arrange(Year, desc(team_medals)) %>% 
    select(Year, Country, team_medals)
top_5_year_summer_df <- sum_top_df %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = team_medals, n = 5) %>%
  ungroup()


#top countries: winter
win_top_df <- win_medals_year_country_df %>%  group_by(Year, Country) %>% 
    arrange(Year, desc(team_medals)) %>% 
    select(Year, Country, team_medals)
top_5_year_winter_df <- win_top_df %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = team_medals, n = 5) %>%
  ungroup()

#plot time series for both summer and winter
g<- top_countries_plot(top_5_year_winter_df, Title = "Top 5 Countries in Winter Olympics Over Time")
g
h <- top_countries_plot(top_5_year_summer_df, Title = "Top 5 Countries in Summer Olympics Over Time")
h

```




# Including an external plot

You can also include plots produced outside of your Rmarkdown file using the package *knitr*

See below chunk:

```{r, out.width = "205px", fig.cap=figures("Some Figure"), eval = F}

knitr::include_graphics("YourFigureLocation/Logo.png")

```


FYI - R also recently introduced the gt package, which is worthwhile exploring too.

# Lists

To add lists, simply using the following notation

* This is really simple

    + Just note the spaces here - writing in R you have to sometimes be pedantic about spaces...

* Note that Rmarkdown notation removes the pain of defining \LaTeX environments!

# Conclusion

I hope you find this template useful. Remember, stackoverflow is your friend - use it to find answers to questions. Feel free to write me a mail if you have any questions regarding the use of this package. To cite this package, simply type citation("Texevier") in Rstudio to get the citation for @Texevier (Note that uncited references in your bibtex file will not be included in References).
