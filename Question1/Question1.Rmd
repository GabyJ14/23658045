<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Lets load in example data, and see how this can be stored and later called from your 'data' folder.

# Introduction \label{Introduction}
Write a short introduction here. 


#Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section I examine the overall trends in baby names over the years. 
```{r}
#summarise the top baby names by year and gender
top_national_baby <- baby_names %>% 
    group_by(Name, Year, Gender) %>% 
    summarise(Total_Count_year = sum(Count)) %>% 
    arrange(Year, desc(Total_Count_year)) 
 
girls_df<- top_national_baby %>% 
    filter(Gender == "F")

boys_df <- top_national_baby %>% 
    filter(Gender == "M")

g_top <- g_top_names_history(girls_df)
b_top <- b_top_names_history(boys_df)
 

p <- top_10_plot(g_top, "Top 10 Girls Names over History")
p
h <- top_10_plot(b_top, "Top 10 Boys Names over History")   
h
#can add lowest names

```

Can maybe show the map of the states here with most likes name over the years. 


#Time-Series Analysis
In this section the Spearman rank correlation of the top 25 baby names from each year with the following three years. This rank correlation is then used to analyse the persistence of name popularity over decades, especially focussing on 1990's and onwards. 


```{r}
#spearman function
#boys_df and girls_df is dataframes with names ordered from most popular to least per year

```



#Influence Analysis
In this section I will identify names with significant popularity spikes and correlate them with cultural events such as tv shows, celebrities, artists and songs. 


```{r}

```

#Final remarks


#Conclusion


```{r Figure1,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}



```



```{r Figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}

ExampleData <- read_rds( "data/Example_data.rds")

source("code/Example_Plot_Scatter.R") # Load a function from your 'code' folder. This e.g. plots scatters to your own preferences.
source( "code/Data_Create.R") #

ExampleData <- Data_Create(N = 100) # Same as the ExampleData loaded above - this is just a function to create the stored data.

g <- Example_Plot_Scatter(DataInput = ExampleData,
                          X = "Height_Score",
                          Y = "Weight_Score",
                          Z = "Agility_Score",
                          Theme = theme_bw(), # run ?ggthemes for other themes.
                          Title = "", # I prefer to use the caption set above.
                          Ylab = "Height",
                          Xlab = "Lenght",
                          LegendTitle = "Agility",
                          TitleSize = 10,
                          LabSize = 10)

g


```

To reference the plot above, add a ``\\label'' after the caption in the chunk heading, as done above. Then reference the plot as such: As can be seen, Figures \ref{Figure1}  and \ref{Figure2} are excellent, with Figure \ref{Figure2} being particularly aesthetically pleasing due to its device setting of Tikz. The nice thing now is that it correctly numbers all your figures (and sections or tables) and will update if it moves. The links are also dynamic.




# Including an external plot

You can also include plots produced outside of your Rmarkdown file using the package *knitr*

See below chunk:

```{r, out.width = "205px", fig.cap=figures("Some Figure"), eval = F}

knitr::include_graphics("YourFigureLocation/Logo.png")

```


FYI - R also recently introduced the gt package, which is worthwhile exploring too.

# Lists

To add lists, simply using the following notation

* This is really simple

    + Just note the spaces here - writing in R you have to sometimes be pedantic about spaces...

* Note that Rmarkdown notation removes the pain of defining \LaTeX environments!
